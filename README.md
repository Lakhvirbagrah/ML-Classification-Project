# ML-Classification-Project
During this project, we performed Multiple Classification techniuqes like Logistic Regression, naïve Bayes, SVM and we not only showed a person is happy or sad but also showed percentage of emotions. we performed PCA and LDA on the data and used different methods to visualize the data. After performing different classification techniuqes, we also compared the results and showed which techniuqe performed better.   

Steps Performed During Projects: 
a.	Sampled a subset of the data based on class label 
b.	Applied PCA and LDA and visualize the results
c.	Performed classification using naïve Bayes and interpret the results 
d.	Performed classification using Logistic Regression and interpret the results
e.	Performed classification using SVMs and interpret the results
f.	comment on which approaches might allow you to best identify the confidence of class assignments (e.g. how happy, or how sad rather than just a label)
g.	Ploted results based on the approach in f.
h.	Applied PCA and LDA. For PCA, plot the incremental gain in capturing the variance in the data for each successive principal component that is added and compare this with the subset of data in step 1. 
i.	Performed classification using naïve Bayes and interpret and visualize the results.
j.	Performed classification using Logistic Regression and interpret and visualize the results 
k.	Performed classification using SVMs and interpret and visualize the results 
l.	Discussed which classes are most similar / different with some justification given 
m.	Explained how you might identify faces that are mislabeled in the dataset and provide an implementation.
